# ITT-Internship

This repository contains all my assignments, practice files and project-related files created during the period of my internship at In Time Tec  Visionsoft Pvt. Ltd.
As of 27/07/21, it contains 2 Python notebooks; one exploring Numpy and the other exploring Pandas.
I plan to add one more such file wherein I'll be exploring Matplotlib.

By Friday, I will add solution files to my assignments as well.
